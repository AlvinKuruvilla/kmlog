# KMLog

KMLog is an interactive cli application for interfacing with tools which collect typing dynamics

## Rationale

The goal of this project is to create a sleek and lightweight interface to collect specific typing dynamics data from real people

## Code Breakdown

### The _"base"_ folder

This folder holds python files for the project's core functionality:

- csv_writer.py: A wrapper class that allows for writing data to a csv file
- log.py: This is a wrapper class of the loguru module for more colorful and expressive logging
- util.py: This file holds some utility functions to make the tui prettier and more functional.
- backends: This folder hold files that wrap specific subsystems, one of which, the project uses (or could use) for operations (querying, storage, etc...)
  - sql_driver.py: This file holds a wrapper class to make some sql operations nicer
  - yaml_driver.py: This file holds a wrapper class to make yaml operations nicer
- user_ops: This folder holds files that wrap specific user-related functions and operations
  - generic_ops.py: A set of generic functions to get user information and properly format it
  - sql_ops.py: A specialized set of MySQL specific functions and operations to properly add and retrieve user information from a MySQL database
  - yml_ops.py: A specialized set of YAML specific functions and operations to properly add and retrieve user information from a YAML file

### The _"tools"_ folder

This folder holds the keylogger and mouse tracker to collect typing dynamics data.

### The _"logs"_ folder

This folder holds the log and csv files generated by the keylogger and the mouse tracker

### The _".env"_ file

The use of the .env file was a strategic decision to allow for future users of this code base to be able to adapt it to their needs with as little code modifications as possible. The use of the .env file also improves the secrecy and security associated with connecting to the mysql database as none of the connection information is written into the code, but rather read in from created environment variables.
The .env file contains the following variables:

- KM_USER: The username to connect to the database
- PASSWORD: The password to connect to the database
- DB_HOST: The host used to connect to the database
- DB_NAME: The name of the database which will be operated on
- TABLE: The name of the database table which will be operated on

See sample.env for an example .env configuration

```diff
- NOTE: If you decide to change the names of the environment variables make sure that they do not conflict with an Operating System specific predefined variables. For example USER in MacOS and USERNAME in Windows -
```

## MySQL Installation

### [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mysql#default)

For macs install homebrew and run:

```sh
brew install mysql
```

### [MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html)

The MySQL documentation recommends using the MySQL Installer for Windows

## MySQL Setup

To ensure that mysql is installed correctly run:

```sh
mysql --version
```

### **<u>Windows</u>**

The MySQL installer should take care of everything
To start the mysql interactive cli run:

```sh
mysql -u [YOUR_USERNAME] -p
```

### **<u>MacOS</u>**

Start MySQL server by running:

```sh
brew services start mysql
```

Secure installation of MySQL Server:

```sh
mysql_secure_installation
```

Like for Windows, to start the MySQL cli run:

```sh
mysql -u [YOUR_USERNAME] -p
```

## User Information Storage in YAML

The YAML backed system is a simpler local storage alternative to the MySQL database
The YAML system uses the users inputted user-id to search through the "users" folder to see if a YAML file already exists with a matching file name. If it does we know the user already exists in the "database" and we can just pull their information from the file. If the file does not exist, we can create one and add it to the "database"
The YAML file stores data in the following format:

```yaml
user_id: Integer
first_name: String
last_name: String
age: Integer
gender: String
handedness: String
education: String
platform: String
```

See 123.yaml for more details

## Usage

### Build with pip

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlvinKuruvilla/kmlog.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main file

```bash
python3 tui.py
```

### Automated Build

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlvinKuruvilla/kmlog.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 -r requirements.txt
```

3. Build the executable

```bash
./build.sh
```

4. Run kmlog

```bash
./kmlog
```

### Running from Github release

1. Download the binary from the release page.

2. Change the permissions of the binary file so it is executable

   - This could be done with a command like:

   ```bash
     chmod 777 kmlog
   ```

3. If your shell kills the executable when trying to run it, this is because Apple does not allow programs to run which are from unidentifiable developers. To fix this, navigate to System Preferences > Go to Privacy and Security > Go to the General tab > Click Run Anyway
