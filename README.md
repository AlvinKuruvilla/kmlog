## Rationale
The goal of this project was to create a sleek and lightweight interface to collect specific typing dynamics data 
## Code Breakdown
### The *"base"* folder
This folder holds python files that the cli needs to import such as:

- util.py: this file simply holds a utility function to pretty print "KMLog".
- user.py: this function holds a function to ask the user information about themselves and store that information in a MySQL database.
- sql.py: This file holds a wrapper class to make some sql operations (querying the database, and inserting into the database) slightly nicer.
- log.py: This is a wrapper class of the inbuilt python 'logging' module for more colorful and expressive logging throughout the other parts of this project

### The *"tools"* folder
This folder holds the keylogger and mouse tracker to collect typing dynamics data.

### The *"logs"* folder
This folder holds the log files generated by the keylogger and the mouse tracker.
### The *".env"* file
The use of the .env file was a strategic decision to allow for future users of this code base to be able to adapt it to their needs with as little code modifications as possible. The use of the .env file also improves the secrecy and security associated with connecting to the mysql database as none of the connection information is wrote into the code, but rather read in from environment variables.
The .env file contains the following variables:
  - USERNAME: The username to connect to the database
  - PASSWORD: The password to connect to the database
  - DB_HOST: The host used to connect to the database
  - DB_NAME: The name of the database which will be operated on
  - TABLE: The name of the database table which will be operated on

See sample.env for an example .env configuration
## MySQL Installation
### [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/htmlq)
For macs install homebrew and run:
```sh
brew install mysql
```
### [MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html)
The MySQL documentation recommends using the MySQL Installer for Windows 

## MySQL Setup
To ensure that mysql is installed correctly run:
```sh
mysql --version
```
### **<u>Windows</u>**
The MySQL installer should take care of everything
To start the mysql interactive cli run:
```sh
mysql -u [YOUR_USERNAME] -p
```
### **<u>MacOS</u>**
Start MySQL server by running:
```sh
brew services start mysql
```
Secure installation of MySQL Server:
```sh
mysql_secure_installation
```
Like for Windows, to start the MySQL cli run:
```sh
mysql -u [YOUR_USERNAME] -p
```
## Usage
Clone this repository. After installing all necessary packages cd into the kmlog directory and run:

```bash
python3 cli.py
```
